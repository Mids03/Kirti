## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to keep track of assignments, project deadlines, and study schedules scattered across different platforms. Existing tools are often too complex or require internet access. [cite_start]There is a need for a lightweight, offline-capable tool to centralize academic tasks[cite: 99].

## Scope of the Project
The project is a desktop-based CLI application focused on personal task management. It handles user data securely and stores task lists locally. [cite_start]It does not currently support cloud synchronization or multi-user real-time collaboration[cite: 100].

## Target Users
* University and School Students
* Self-learners tracking curriculum progress
* [cite_start]Academics managing research deadlines [cite: 102]

## High-Level Features
* **Secure Access:** Individual user accounts to ensure privacy.
* **Workflow Management:** Users can move tasks from "Pending" to "Completed".
* **Insight Generation:** Visual breakdown of task efficiency.
* [cite_start]**Error Logging:** System logs errors for troubleshooting without crashing the app[cite: 103].
