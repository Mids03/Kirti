2. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Academic Task Manager (ATM) is a standalone Command Line Interface (CLI) 
application designed to assist students in managing their academic obligations 
efficiently. Developed using Python, this project leverages Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) principles to provide a secure and persistent environment for 
tracking assignments, projects, and study schedules. The system addresses the 
need for a lightweight, offline tool that does not require complex installation 
or internet connectivity to function.

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Students currently face significant challenges in tracking multiple deadlines 
across various subjects. Relying on scattered methods—such as physical diaries, 
sticky notes, or complex online tools—often leads to missed deadlines and 
increased academic stress. There is a clear need for a centralized, digital, 
and offline-capable solution that allows students to record, prioritize, and 
monitor the status of their academic tasks in one secure location.

4. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The system includes the following functional modules:

1. User Management Module:
   - Registration: Allows new users to create an account with a unique username.
   - Authentication: Secure login using password verification.
   - Session Management: Handling user logout.

2. Task Management Module (CRUD):
   - Create: Users can add new tasks with a Title, Description, and Priority.
   - Read: Users can view a formatted list of their specific tasks.
   - Update: Users can modify the status of a task (e.g., Pending to Completed).
   - Delete: Users can permanently remove tasks from the records.

3. Analytics Module:
   - Reporting: The system calculates productivity metrics, displaying the 
     total number of tasks, the count of completed items, and an overall 
     efficiency percentage.

5. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Security: Passwords are strictly hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm before 
   storage; no plain-text passwords are saved.
2. Persistence: All data is automatically saved to a local JSON file 
   (app_data.json) immediately after any modification.
3. Reliability: The system ensures data availability across sessions.
4. Error Handling: The application utilizes try-except blocks to manage invalid 
   user inputs (e.g., entering text for numeric IDs) to prevent crashes.
5. Logging: Operational events (logins, errors, updates) are recorded in a 
   separate log file (app.log) for auditing and debugging.

6. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project utilizes a Modular Monolithic Architecture:

- Presentation Layer: The 'Application' class manages the Command Line Interface, 
  accepting user inputs and displaying outputs.
- Business Logic Layer: The 'UserManager', 'TaskManager', and 'AnalyticsEngine' 
  classes handle the core rules and processing.
- Data Access Layer: The 'DataManager' class abstracts the file I/O operations 
  required to read and write to the JSON storage.
- Security Layer: The 'SecurityService' class provides static methods for 
  cryptographic hashing.

7. DESIGN DIAGRAMS

(Note: Please insert relevant diagrams in the final document)

A. Use Case Diagram:
   - Actor: Student
   - Use Cases: Register, Login, Add Task, View Tasks, Update Status, 
     Delete Task, View Analytics.

B. Workflow Diagram:
   - Start -> Auth Menu -> Login -> Main Dashboard -> Choose Operation 
     -> Execute Logic -> Update Data Store -> Return to Dashboard.

C. Class Diagram:
   - Shows relationships between Application (Controller), Manager classes 
     (Logic), and Data/Security classes (Utilities).

8. DESIGN DECISIONS & RATIONALE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Storage Format (JSON): JSON was selected over SQLite because it is lightweight, 
  human-readable, and requires no external database server, satisfying the 
  constraint for a portable student project.
- Security Algorithm (SHA-256): Chosen because it is a standard, irreversible 
  hashing algorithm included in Python's standard library, ensuring compliance 
  with security requirements.
- Interface (CLI): A text-based interface was chosen to prioritize logic 
  implementation and performance over graphical overhead.

9. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Language: Python 3.x
- Libraries Used: 
  - `json`: For data serialization.
  - `hashlib`: For password encryption.
  - `os`: For file system checks.
  - `logging`: For tracking application events.
  - `datetime`: For timestamping creation dates.
- Structure: The code is organized into distinct classes to ensure high cohesion 
  and low coupling.

10. SCREENSHOTS / RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Space for Screenshots]
1. Screenshot of the Registration/Login menu.
2. Screenshot of the Task List display.
3. Screenshot of the Productivity Report output.

11. TESTING APPROACH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Unit Testing: Verified the `hash_password` function to ensure consistent outputs.
- Integration Testing: Tested the full workflow of Creating a Task -> Viewing it 
  -> Updating it -> Verifying the change in the JSON file.
- Boundary Testing: Tested password length limits and invalid menu selections 
  to ensure the error handling logic works correctly.

12. CHALLENGES FACED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Data Corruption: Initial tests showed that the program crashed if the data 
  file was empty. This was resolved by implementing a check in `DataManager` 
  to initialize a default structure if the file is missing or empty.
- Input Validation: Handling non-integer inputs in menu selection required 
  adding specific `ValueError` exception handling.

13. LEARNINGS & KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance).
- Importance of separating concerns (Data vs. Logic vs. Presentation).
- Techniques for secure data handling (Hashing).
- Managing file I/O and JSON parsing in Python.

14. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Implementing a frontend using Tkinter or PyQt.
- Deadline Alerts: Adding a notification system for approaching due dates.
- Search Functionality: Adding the ability to search for tasks by keywords.
